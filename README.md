## Overview of Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
After completing the initial requested analysis with Bobby using SQL and CSV files a new request was issued.   This request was to do a deep dive of the Pewlette-Hackard employees to identify the number of potentially retiring employees by title and those that would be eligible for a mentorship program to help avoid any employee shortages.

- The above analysis shows the total count of employees who fall into the retirement criteria given.   
- Approximately 90,000 current employees fit the criteria for retirement out of the total employee pool of approximately 300,000 employees.
- The hardest hit employee level is at the "Senior" level with almost 60,000 employees which accounts for almost 66% of the total potential retirees.
- The hardest hit department would be the "Engineering" department that could lose almost 45,000 employees which is almost 50% of total potential retirees.

## Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis Summary
Based on the analysis the Pewlett-Hackard initiative was absolutley needed if the given age retirement metrics ring true.   I would recommend a company wide survey to determine when the Senior employees are planning on retiring and if there are potential short term monetary incentives to smooth the rate at which they retire.   

Specifically in the Engineering deparment the company must start cross training with the proposed mentorship program to avoid issues in keeping the same level of productivity. Another analysis should also be run in regards to the pay bands at which the company has with those they wish to retain and make asure that it lines up with the vision from the C suite which could further effect who to retain and how many. 

In addition to the monetary analysis, it would be very valuable to know what percentage are the potential retirees broken out by level and department. For instance, if there are only 2 in the "Manager" level and both retire you could be in a tough spot by losing 100% of your employees that complete that job.
